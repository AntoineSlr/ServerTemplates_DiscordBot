# ServerTemplates_DiscordBot
A Discord Bot for #HackWeek that will allow you to create new servers way faster

Creating a new Discord server is always a fun experience, but it can become pretty time consuming.

The main purpose of ServerTemplate bot is to save time and effort when creating a new Discord Server.

The way it works is : it should be invited in newly created Discord servers, and it will set up the main channels and their categories automatically.

You will be given different server templates either via a help command or a dedicated website for this bot.

My idea in the future is, it would become an actual feature within Discord, because I can already tell that a Discord bot for this purpose wouldn't be the best option.
That's why I've decided to focus mainly on a few examples for the bot, and then conceptualise how it could be implemented in Discord itself.
I hope that you appreciate this project.
