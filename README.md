# ServerTemplates_DiscordBot
**A Discord Bot for #HackWeek that will allow you to create new servers way faster**

Creating a new Discord server is always a fun experience, but it can become pretty time consuming.

The main purpose of ServerTemplatesBot is to save time and effort when creating a new Discord Server.

The way it works is : it should be invited in newly created Discord servers, and it will set up the main channels and roles automatically.

You will be given different server templates via a help command (or a dedicated website for this bot, in the future).

My idea in the future is, it would become an actual feature within Discord, because I can already tell that even though a Discord bot for this purpose works fine, it might not be the best option.

That's why I've decided to focus mainly on a couple examples for the bot, and then conceptualise how it could be implemented in Discord itself.

You can invite the bot here : https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=592800638841126912&permissions=8&scope=bot

I hope that you appreciate this project.
